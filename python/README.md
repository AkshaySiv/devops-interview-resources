# Smallest Positive Integer Missing

## Problem Statement

Write a function:

```python
def solution(A):
```

that, given an array `A` of `N` integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in `A`.

### Examples

- Given `A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2]`, the function should return `5`.
- Given `A = [1, 2, 3]`, the function should return `4`.
- Given `A = [-1, -3]`, the function should return `1`.

### Constraints

- `N` is an integer within the range [1..100,000]
- Each element of array `A` is an integer within the range [-1,000,000..1,000,000]

**Write an efficient algorithm for the given assumptions.**
