### **Question**

What happens in baground when you run `ls` command

### **Answer:**
When you run the `ls` command, the shell locates the `ls` binary using the `$PATH` environment variable. It then creates a child process to execute the binary, which interacts with the filesystem to retrieve and display the directory contents.
